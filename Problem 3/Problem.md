### Sort And Write In File
Write a Python program which allows you to extract the content of one.txt and second.txt sort them and write it in another file called ouput.txt.

Given files for each testcase:-
1. one.txt - which contains the first set of numbers.
2. second.txt - which contains the second set of numbers.


You have to generate a new file - 'output.txt' which contains result. Put this newly generated file in the same folder.
