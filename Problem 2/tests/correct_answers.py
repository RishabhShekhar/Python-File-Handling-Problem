d['Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.'] = '5813f560b6238393277640c4a665c1174d2c85a923e12ff109506a15'
d['Programme is a sequence of instructions written in a proper language through which the computer can understand and solve the problem given to it. It is the method by which the whole computing process is directed and controlled. Preparing a programme for the computer is known as “programming”. A programme should be recorded on a proper medium which the computer can process. Usually punched cards are used for this purpose. Each computer can understand one language which is known as “machine language”. Machine language contains use of numeral codes and each computer has its own machine language. It is very difficult to write a programme in this language. To obliterate this difficulty, some other languages have been developed.'] = '3680994eb8335bfe15e97bab17f2caf6214b3137d7ad6b0f29ca90d4'
